# Installation

## From source

There are currently no pre-compiled finalfrontier binaries. Compilation
requires a working [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) toolchain. After
installing Rust, you can compile finalfrontier using cargo:

~~~shell
$ cargo install finalfrontier-utils
~~~

Afterwards, the binaries are available in your `~/.cargo/bin`.
