\f[B]ff\-compute\-accuracy\f[R] \[en] evaluate a model with analogies
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]ff\-compute\-accuracy\f[R] [\f[I]options\f[R]] \f[I]model\f[R]
[\f[I]analogies\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[I]ff\-convert\f[R] evaluates a model using analogies of the form
`\f[I]a\f[R] is to \f[I]a*\f[R] as \f[I]b\f[R] is to \f[I]b*\f[R]'.
The model is given \f[I]a\f[R], \f[I]a*\f[R], and \f[I]b\f[R] and should
predict \f[I]b*\f[R].
This utility is similar to word2vec\[cq]s \f[I]compute\-accuracy\f[R],
however the rules are more strict:
.IP "1." 3
The model\[cq]s full vocabulary is used during evaluation.
.IP "2." 3
Evaluation instances are only skipped when \f[I]b*\f[R] is absent in the
vocabulary.
If the model is not able to handle one of the query tokens, this is
counted as an erroneous prediction of the model.
.IP "3." 3
The case of a token\[cq]s characters are reserved.
.SH File format
.PP
An analogies file consists of sections followed by analogies.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
: capital\-common\-countries
Athens Greece Baghdad Iraq
Athens Greece Bangkok Thailand
: city\-in\-state
Chicago Illinois Houston Texas
Chicago Illinois Philadelphia Pennsylvania
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Section identifiers are preceded by a colon and a space.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \f[C]\-\-threads\f[R] \f[I]N\f[R]
The number of thread to use during evaluation for parallelization.
The default is to use half of the logical CPUs of the machine.
